# DASHBOARD

## Operating Notes

- This dashboard is the shared coordination surface for the manager agent and human.
- Keep one entry per worktree and one worktree per active local branch.
- Branch/worktree coverage is complete right now: all local branches have a worktree.
- Task order is a strict queue: execute from top to bottom.
- Default policy: always attack the first task in `Tasks Ongoing`.
- Exception: start from `Tasks Planned` only when the user/manager explicitly directs it.
- For `Tasks Planned`, omit validation details unless non-standard validation is needed.
- `Decision:` is a special user-controlled field that sets next step for a task.
- `Decision: pending` means the task is blocked and not a candidate for action.
- When an agent starts a task, it removes that task's `Decision:` field.
- Special status `locked` means an agent is actively working on that task.
- Commit and PR messages must follow `COMMIT_CONVENTION.md`.
- If a branch has one commit, PR title/body are derived from the commit message.
- If a branch has multiple commits, the corresponding task entry must include explicit `PR Title` and `PR Body` before PR submission.
- Status tags:
  - `needs: rebase`: branch has an open PR and should be rebased/synced with `upstream/main`.
  - `needs: progress`: no open PR yet; work is still local/draft.
  - `needs: decision`: non-standard state (coordination branch, detached worktree, or baseline mirror).
  - `needs review from human`: branch work is ready for human review/approval.
  - `pending on human action`: task is paused until explicit human follow-up.
  - `special`: management/baseline worktree entry (not an implementation task).
  - `locked`: task is currently being executed by an agent.
- PR mapping below uses the last successful GitHub query from this session. Re-run `gh api repos/leanprover/verso/pulls --paginate` when network is available.

## Task Entry Format

- Planned task format:
```markdown
- [ ] `<task title>`
  - Scope: `<where change applies>`
  - Observation: `<what we saw>`
  - Impact: `<why it matters>`
  - Proposed fix: `<intended change>`
  - Expected effort: `<small|medium|large + note>`
  - Status: `<needs: ...>`
  - Decision: `<user-provided next step>`
```

- Ongoing task format:
```markdown
- [ ] `<branch or task>`
  - Path: `<absolute worktree path>`
  - Status: `keep (<needs: ...>)` or `keep (pending on human action)` or `special` or `locked`
  - Decision: `<user-provided next step>`   # `pending` blocks action; removed by agent when task is being executed
  - PR Title: `<required before PR submission when branch has >1 commit>`
  - PR Body: `<required before PR submission when branch has >1 commit>`
  - PR: `<#id + url>` or `none` or `n/a`
  - Ahead/Behind vs `upstream/main`: `+X/-Y`   # optional
  - Summary: `<one-line branch summary>`
  - Notes: `<state and special context>`
```

## Tasks Planned (Not Started)

- [ ] `Concrete.lean` task A: remove duplicate genre resolution in `verso` term elaboration.
  - Scope: `/home/egallego/lean/verso/src/verso/Verso/Doc/Concrete.lean` around the `elab_rules : term` for `verso`.
  - Observation: `findGenreTm` is called twice on the same explicit genre path.
  - Impact: redundant resolution/info work and avoidable noise in elaboration traces.
  - Proposed fix: keep a single `findGenreTm` call in the `some g` branch and remove the extra pre-pass.
  - Expected effort: small (about 5 lines, low risk).
  - Status: `needs: progress`.
  - Decision: pending (set by user)

- [ ] `Concrete.lean` task B: make incremental `#doc` ref-info emission linear.
  - Scope: `/home/egallego/lean/verso/src/verso/Verso/Doc/Concrete.lean` in `runVersoBlock`/`saveRefsInEnv` and environment threading.
  - Observation: incremental mode re-pushes all ref custom info each block; current behavior trends quadratic in top-level block count.
  - Impact: unnecessary elaboration overhead for larger docs and noisier info trees.
  - Proposed fix: track emitted ref progress in `DocElabEnvironment` and push only newly added def/use syntax per ref key.
  - Expected effort: medium (state extension + delta computation + regression checks).
  - Status: `needs: progress`.
  - Decision: pending (set by user)
